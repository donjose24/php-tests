Will add future tests on this on the future, preferrably mocking using `Mockery` and other stuff

## Setting Up

2.) Copy `phpunit.xml.dist` to another file, `phpunit.xml`  
3.) After installing the dependencies, run `vendor/bin/phpunit` to run the tests, or to run the testsuite, add `--testsuite="Unit Test Suites"` to your command.
